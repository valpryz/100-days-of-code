# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 14, 2018 

   Today I start again #100DaysOfCode from scratch .. I have only a tiny knowledge of HMTL and CSS but I still have not designed anything with them, my level in mathematics and logic is pretty bad .. My goal is to get the certifications Google Mobile Web Specialist ( https://developers.google.com/training/certification/mobile-web-specialist/ )and Google Android Associate Developer ( https://developers.google.com/training/certification/associate-android-developer/ ) .. here I present the path traveled. I hope I have enough courage and perseverance to make it happen ... and I hope that my journey will inspire other members.
   I start this journey with a laptop lenovo G550 under Windows 7 & Linux Ubuntu 16.04 dual boot .. I will also post all the resources used for these studies.
   Before starting i have already completed the course html5 and css of freecodecamp https://www.freecodecamp.org/map and intro to html & css of udacity https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-html-and-css--ud304. and I'm also studying udacity math courses https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-algebra-review--ma004
