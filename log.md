# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 31, 2019 0mn

   Tomorrow I will start again #100DaysOfCode from scratch .. I have only a tiny knowledge of HMTL and CSS but I still have not designed anything with them, my level in mathematics and logic is pretty bad .. My goal is to get the certifications Google Mobile Web Specialist ( https://developers.google.com/training/certification/mobile-web-specialist/ ) and Google Android Associate Developer ( https://developers.google.com/training/certification/associate-android-developer/ )
